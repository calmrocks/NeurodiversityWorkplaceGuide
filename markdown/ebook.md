This book is an amalgamation of personal experiences, extensive research, and valuable insights from experts and neurodivergent professionals. It aims to bridge the gap between neurodivergent individuals and the workplaces they enrich, offering practical advice, relatable examples, and a path towards a more inclusive professional world.

## What to Expect
